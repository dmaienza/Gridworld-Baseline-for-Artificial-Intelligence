# Gridworld-Baseline-for-Artificial-Intelligence

Program in Python producing an environment with obstacles and goals which serves as a "playground" for testing algorithms.

Learning algorithms guide the agent to the goal by navigating obstacles. The learning algorithms are composed of a move function, a value function, a reward function, a policy function, and an animate function to depict the algorithm to the programmer.
